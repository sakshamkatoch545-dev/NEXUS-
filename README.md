## 📖 Overview

**NEXUS+** is a state-of-the-art, multi-modal image forensic platform engineered to detect AI-generated synthetic media with absolute precision. In an era where diffusion models like Midjourney v6, SDXL, and DALL-E 3 create hyper-realistic imagery, traditional single-model detection methods fail catastrophically. 

NEXUS+ solves this by cross-referencing **high-level semantic embeddings** with **microscopic, low-level signal processing** (Fourier transforms, Error Level Analysis, and micro-texture variance) to expose the invisible fingerprints that every AI generator leaves behind.

### ✨ Key Highlights
- 🧠 **12 Specialized Detection Engines** — deep, multi-domain analysis
- ⚡ **Instant Verdicts** — AI-Generated / Uncertain / Authentic  
- 📊 **Per-Engine Breakdown** — see exactly what each engine found
- 🎨 **Premium Glassmorphism UI** — modern, dark, and strikingly beautiful
- 🔄 **Self-Improving** — supports local fine-tuning with your own dataset

## 🖥️ How It Works — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Launch the App

Open your terminal, activate your virtual environment, and run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Your browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

### Step 2 — Upload an Image

On the **left column**, you will see the **Image Payload** card. Drag & drop any image (JPG, PNG, WEBP) into it, or click **Browse File** to open a file picker.

<p align="center">
  <img src="sample_images/ai%20image.jpeg" alt="AI Generated Example" width="42%">
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <img src="sample_images/American-actress-Sydney-Sweeney-2022.webp" alt="Real Photograph Example" width="42%">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Left: An AI-generated image (high saturation, unnaturally smooth textures, studio backdrop) — Right: A real photograph with natural lighting and organic detail</em>
</p>

After uploading, a preview of your image appears inside the card. Below it are the **12 Active Engines** listed — all 12 engines will be engaged once you fire the scan.

---

### Step 3 — Execute Forensic Scan

Click the glowing **⚡ Execute Forensic Scan** button. The system begins running all 12 engines in parallel, performing:
- Neural classification via HuggingFace pipelines
- CLIP zero-shot semantic embedding comparison  
- Computer vision analysis (FFT, ELA, texture, symmetry)
- Local ViT model inference (if trained)
- Watermark margin detection

---

### Step 4 — Review the Verdict

The **right column** transforms to show your full forensic report:

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/nexus_results.png" alt="NEXUS+ App Screenshot - Scan Results" width="90%">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The verdict panel showing a high-confidence AI-Generated result with 87.3% AI probability</em>
</p>

The **verdict box** displays one of four outcomes:
| Verdict | Meaning | Color |
|---|---|---|
| 🚨 **AI-GENERATED** | Strong AI signature detected across multiple engines | 🔴 Red |
| 🪄 **LIKELY REAL BUT EDITED BY AI** | Genuine camera foundation with localized AI inpainting, neural edits, or filters | 🟠 Amber |
| ⚠️ **UNCERTAIN** | Mixed signals — borderline case requiring review | 🟡 Yellow |
| ✅ **AUTHENTIC** | Natural camera characteristics confirmed | 🟢 Green |

The **Human vs AI Breakdown** tab shows:
- **AI Threat Score** out of 100
- **Human Confidence %** vs **AI Probability %** metric cards
- A **Forensic Summary** explaining the key findings in plain language

---

### Step 5 — Drill Into Each Engine

Switch to the **🔬 12-Engine Forensics** tab for the full deep-dive:

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/nexus_engines.png" alt="NEXUS+ App Screenshot - Engine Breakdown" width="90%">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The 12-Engine Forensics tab — each engine shows its own score, risk badge, progress bar, and detailed explanation</em>
</p>

Each engine card shows:
- **Engine icon and name**
- **Risk badge** — `HIGH AI RISK`, `MODERATE`, or `LOW AI RISK`
- **Score** (e.g. `87 / 100`) with human/AI split percentage
- **Animated progress bar** colored by risk level
- **Detailed explanation** — a paragraph describing what the engine found and why it scored the image the way it did

# AI provenance engine (v6)

The detector now includes `ai_provenance`, a dedicated weak-signal engine for
ChatGPT/GPT Image, Gemini/Imagen, and other modern generators. It combines
generator-family semantic compatibility with available EXIF/C2PA hints and
reports `nearest_generator`, `similarity`, `detected_artifacts`, and
`feature_scores` in the main JSON response. It does not claim exact provider
attribution: resizing, screenshots, and social-media recompression can remove
provenance and alter visual evidence.

To enable the multimodal API engine, configure secrets outside source control:

```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-key"
$env:GROQ_API_KEY = "your-groq-key"
streamlit run app.py
```

The code tries Gemini first and Groq vision as a fallback. API keys are never
written to the repository or returned in analysis results.
